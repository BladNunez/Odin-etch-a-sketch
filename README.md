# Odin-etch-a-sketch

This small project allows me to practice my DOM manipulation skills in JavaScript. This project has me build an etch a sketch of some sort and I start off by creating a 16x16 matrix of squares that will be displayed on my browser. You are then able to move the mouse over the matrix of squares to change the color of each div (square). A button is created and will ask the user to enter a number and whatever that number is the browser will render that amount as a 'numxnum' grid.
